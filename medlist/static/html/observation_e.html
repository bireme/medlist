It is primarily intended to indicate similar clinical performance within a
pharmacological class. The listed medicine should be the example of the class for which there is the best
evidence for effectiveness and safety. In some cases, this may be the first medicine that is licensed for
marketing; in other instances, subsequently licensed compounds may be safer or more effective. Where there
is no difference in terms of efficacy and safety data, the listed medicine should be the one that is generally
available at the lowest price, based on international drug price information sources. Not all square boxes are
applicable to medicine selection for children â€” see the second EMLc for details.
Therapeutic equivalence is only indicated on the basis of reviews of efficacy and safety and when consistent
with WHO clinical guidelines. National lists should not use a similar symbol and should be specific in their
final selection, which would depend on local availability and price.
