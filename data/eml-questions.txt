Q1. page 15: Immediately after the section heading "6.5.5.1 African trypanosomiasis" there is a sub-heading titled "Medicines for the treatment of 1st stage African trypanosomiasis", and a further below in the same page there is a sub-heading "Medicines for the treatment of 2nd stage African trypanosomiasis". Can these be considered sections 6.5.5.1.1 and 6.5.5.1.2?
